# Lesson 8 - Gravitation - 08/07/2022

## Preparation (mathematics)
* units and standard units -- from quliatative (understanding) to quantative
    * Space: Length - meter (m)
    * Time:  Time - second  (s)
    * Stuff, things: Mass - kilogram (kg)
    * ---- (derived units) -- see a pattern, describe the pattern, and give the pattern a formula (quantifying)
    * Force (Newton's 2nd law): F = m a : kg m/s^2 --> Newton (N) 
    * Momentum: p = m v - a better description of the nature (pattern)  -> kg m/s -- F = dp/dt -- "GOD creates force"
    * Kinetic Energy: there is certain constant in 3D (eg length)
        * kinetic energy to momentum is the same as length to x,y,z 
    * Potential Energy: is the energy in position
    * --> Energe conservation: T = P + K
    * Rotation -- Trigonometry -- Projection - Cosine
   
   ## Planetary 
   * Planets and sun and stars rotate around earth -- a qualitative understanding -- seems correct
   * Planets including earth is rotating around the sun in a circle -- a quantatizing effort leading to this hypothesis 
   * People spend their life observing planets -- planets are doing their *regular* pattern, but we do not know how to describing them
   * Kepler's three law of planet motion
        1. The orbit is an eclipse, with one of the focal point at the sun
        2. The orbit sweeps the same area per unit time
        3. The ration of square of Period with cube of the major radius is constant for planets --> a universal law 
   
   ## The graviation
   * A universal formula describe the motion of planets -- change of motion === force -- universal force
   * This universal pattern applies to all all objects in the universe, in the heaven or on earth
   * There is force between any two objects
       * F = G (m1 m2) / r^2
       * Since the sun mass is so big and it is a constant, F = (GM) m/r^2
       * Angular momentum does not change. L = I omega = m r^2 omega -- Kepler's 2nd law 
       * a = omega^2 r
       * F = (GM) m/r^2 = omega ^ 2 r --> (GM) m / r^3 = omega ^ 2 -- Kepler's 3rd law 
   
   ## Potential Energy and Field
   * Work = F * s -> potential energy 
   * Change in potential energy --> change in motion
   * Change in potential energy over distance is called "force"
   * Gravitational potential energy -- P_gravitation = G (m1 m2) / r
  
  ## The point charge view
  * F = (GM) m / r^2 = (GM) 1/r^2 * m  --> Field  (GM)/r^2 * m --> inverse square force
  * Imagin the mass (M) is emitting rays of field
