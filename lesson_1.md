# Lesson 1 - Kinematic

## Motion 
Intuition -- movement of an object 

### Ingredients
Critical thinking 
1. Time 
2. Position - Space 

### Measure
Quantifying

Quantifying makes things simple

* Symmetry
    * Translational symetry -- you can't tell the difference from space to space, or time to time, without reference 
    * Symmetry is the basis of measurement
    * E.g. A tick is a tick 
    * What is a tick -- a unit
    * All measurements, or all quantifying effort, is a process of counting unit

Time - measure the time by clock -- seconds, minutes, hours -- standard unit is second
* a hours = a * 1hour = a * 60min = (a*60) min
* To *blindly* apply 2nd-grade math
 
Space - distance -  (2nd grade math) ruler - inches, centimeters, meters, miles, kilometers -- standard unit is meter
      - Direction -- (7th grade math) 
      - paper is 2D, our world is 3D -- dimensions - XYZ - orthgonality -- perpendicular
          -- west and east are not the same direction, but the same dimension
          -- west and up are two different dimension
          -- north and south are another dimension
          -- movement is orthogonal directions are not correlated 
          -- we have rototaional symmetry!
     - dimension, allows you to go around, but limited
     
motion -- movement across space over time - distace over time -- meter/second
       -- 7 mile/hour,  100 meter/min
       -- convert: 7 mile/hour = 7 * 1mile/1hour = 7 * 1610meter/3600 = 3.13 meter/sec
                   100 meter/min = 100 * 1meter/60 = 1.67 meter/sec
       -- speed -- veloctiy - meter/second
       
* Function and graph
    * s(t)  y(x) -- one measurement changes agains another measurement -- physical function
    * s = v*t
    * v = s/t
    * t = s/v
    * a = $\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
    * what if v is not constant
    * 1, 2, 3, ...many, 
    - 0
    - negative number
Plot -- 
  * constant -- no motion - staic
  * linear -- constant velocity
  * curve  -- quadratic curve -- velocity is changing - acceleration
