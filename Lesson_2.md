# Lesson 2

## Velocity graph
1. v = dS / dT
2. s = Sum v(t) * dT

* Case 1. Constant Velocity
     * S = V * dT - 
      * on the graph - _Area of Rectangle_
     
* Case 2. Constant Acceleration - linear velocity
     * v = a * t
     * S = 1/2 t * (a * t) = 1/2 a t^2
     * area of triangle (a, b) = 1/2 a * b
     * example: free-fall is constant acceleration at a = 10 (m/s^2)
     * If you fall for 4 sec, 1/2 * 10 * 4 * 4 = 80 meter

* Case 3. Constant Acceleration, start at $v_0$
     * v = v_0 + a * t
     * s = v_0 * t + 1/2 a t^2

* Case 4. Know the distance, calculate the time
    * h = 1/2 a t^2
    * t = sqrt(2h/a)
    * v = sqrt(2ah)
    * falling down from a 100 meter building, t = sqrt(2*100/10) = 4.47 sec

* Case 5. deacceleration
    * Exactly the same formula, but a is negative

* Concept 1. Circle - made of all equivalent points
* Concept 2. Cosine is a projection
* Concept 3: Pythagras relationship: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

# Dynamics
* Kinematic is about how of motion
* Dynamics is about why
* Newton's law

1. Newton's law #1 - motion does not change unless there is interaction, effort -- Force
2. Newton's law #2 - F = m a, a = F/m
    *  M - Mass - describes the amount of stuff -- kg
    *  a - acceleration - the *change* in motion -- m/s^2
    *  F - Force - is defined as the amount of change is motion times the mass - kg m/s^2 - Newton
3. Newton's law #3 - F = -F' --- A force is between two objects

* Example 1 - corner of table

    * T - tension force -- the interaction between a string and object
        * T is constant along the string
    * G - Gravity force -- weight - mg  -- g = 10m/s^2
    * N - Normal force -- it is a reactive force
    * f - Friction force -- it is reactive to threshold, then constant
    * a_x = (T-f)/M, a_y = (G - N) /M = 0 (G==N)

* Example 2 - Slope

    * G  = Mg
    * N = ? hint: it cancels the force that goind into the surface, from G * cos(a)
    * net force pushing down the slope -- G * sin(a)
    * a = G * sin(a) / M
