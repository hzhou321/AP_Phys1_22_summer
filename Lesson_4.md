# Lesson 4 - 7/10/20222 - Momentum

* p = mv

## Momentum

* F = m a = m * $\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
* Newton's 2nd law describes the details of the motion -- at every moment
* In order to solve problems via Newton's 2nd law, one needs to know and take into account of every detail at every moment
* Sometime this is not practical, e.g. throw punch, we know force happens, but do not know it from instant to instant

* There is a tractional view of the Newton's 2nd law
* A transaction is one quantity moving from one object to another object without changing the quantity 
* A physical view is a view with time
* A transactional view takes time out of the picture

* $F(t) = m * \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
* $F(t)*\Delta t = m * \Delta v = \Delta (mv) = \Delta p$
* _The Total of momentum is constant_

## Force in a spring
* Constant active force (a person is pulling/pushing something)
* Gravity force -- aprox. constant, always downward, G = mg
* Normal force -- always opposite and cancels the other force
   * Note: this is different for force and counter-force
* friction force -- $f = \mu N$
